    <p id="mainDescription"> Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by 
        Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other 
        users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts 
        user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. Early in Roblox's history, 
        it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second 
        half of the 2010s, and this growth was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a 
        virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over             164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all 
         American children under 16. Although Roblox has received 
        generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism 
        for its content moderation, microtransactions, and allegations of 
        exploitative practices toward children.</p>
